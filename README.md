# Dialqueue
A quick project that allows you to temporarily save a list of phone numbers and call/text them. Made for delivery drivers. Currently hosted at [dialqueue.hopto.org](https://dialqueue.hopto.org).

## Planned Updates (near term)
* Use localStorage to save phone number list if page is refreshed
* Add an option for user to set message to automatically fill in text message
